The review materials given by the RGO were very useful because they were composed of key concepts and terminologies that were the foundations of the exam itself.
                    <br><br>The in-house final coaching and stress debriefing program at the end of the review season did not just prepare us mentally but holistically. It was an avenue to control and release overwhelming anxiety as they provided motivational activities."</p>

                    <p class="alumni-p2">"In the preparation period, the pre-boards really helped because it gave mean idea of the level of difficulty the real board exam is going to be like. It prepared me on what to expect and how to deal with my nerves in the BLEPP.  
                    <br><br>The free resources also helped us; especially Theories of Personality which aided me most since it provided a clear and concise summary of the many theories of personality and organized them in a manner that could be easily understood.
                    <br><br>The in-house final coaching allowed us to gain more knowledge from an exceptional speaker while the de-stressing activities lessened our anxiety by incorporating fun activities/games. The Praise and Worship session also helped inputting myself at ease and have confidence that all I need to do is my best and God will do the rest."</p>

                    <p class="alumni-p2">"The Psychological Assessment and Industrial & Organizational  Psychology Study Guide provided by RGO Review Center were two of the most useful quick books in preparing for the exam as they were comprehensive summaries of the topics-these were subjects I found difficult in college.
                    <br><br>I enjoyed the in-house motivation and stress debriefing program with praise and worship activities. These allowed us to bond with our classmates from different schools, meet new friends, and it boosted our self-efficacy in passing the exam."</p>

The lecturers were funny, engaging, and they inspired me to push my intellect beyond its capacity. Their lectures were informative and memorable.
                    <br><br>Apart from the usual lectures and pre-board exams, they not only ensured that we get good test results but also made sure that we did not face stress by helping us let go of our exam anxieties and fears along the way."</p>
